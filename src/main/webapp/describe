In JSF 2.0, it’s recommended to create a JSF page in XHTML file format, a file with a .xhtml extension.

Note:
To use the JSF 2.0 components or features, just declared the JSF namespace at the top of the page.
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html">

faces-config.xml:
In JSF 1.x, you had to declare beans in the faces-config.xml, but this is no longer required in JSF 2.0.

In JSF 1.x, you had to declare the “navigation rule” in “faces-config.xml“, to tell which page to display
when the button is clicked. In JSF 2.0, you can put the page name directly in the button’s “action” attribute.
For simple navigation, it’s more than enough, but, for complex navigation, you are still advised to
use the “navigation rule” in “faces-config.xml“.
